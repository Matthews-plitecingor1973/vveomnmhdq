Oh man, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Antes del cuerpo, and I'm feeling all sorts of ways right now. Like, what did I even just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? It's just... so intense! Felt like I needed to take a walk after or something, but here I am, ranting to you instead. Hey, better than bottling it up, right?

I mean, the pacing was kinda odd at times, but then BOOM, the next second it throws a twist at you, and you're just sitting there, mouth open, cheese puffs in hand, forgetting to eat them. You know when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and you're all hyped, like, Yes, this is gonna be good? But then you start second-guessing if you're really up for whatever emotional rollercoaster it's about to slap you with? That was me.

Seriously, the character development was both brilliant and, like, meh, depending on the scene. Like, one minute you're totally vibing with the main dude, and the next you're wondering if maybe your cat is more emotionally deep. 😂 But there's still something relatable about it... maybe we're all a bit unstable like that at times, who knows?

> Oh, and the cinematography, just wow, sometimes it's so in-your-face you can't look away, and sometimes you're like... okay, folks, let's maybe focus the camera on more than just a dangling lightbulb. But isn't that the fun of it? To 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and sort of dissect these awkward artistic choices with your brain half asleep?

By the end, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be inspired or just confused. Utterly human struggle right there. Haha. Maybe it's a sign that staying up late again wasn't the smartest choice I've ever made. My cactus could probably confirm that. Anyway, is this what being an adult feels like—questioning your life's decisions based on a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 so artsy that even trying to describe it makes you feel like a pretentious art major?

Mind you, here's a random line of code because my brain's fried: `int X = (3 + 4)  5;` Why did I even type that... honestly, the mysteries of my brain are unsolvable.

You think I should give myself some downtime or maybe pick another flick and dive down the rabbit hole again? This is what Tuesdays are for, right? 😅 Let's just hope the next one doesn't leave me existentially spiraling.
